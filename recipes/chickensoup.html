      <li>4 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 head of garlic cut in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
      <li>1 cup cold water</li>
      <li><strong>Stock:</strong></li>
      <li>10 cups cold water</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch of parsley</li>
      <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
      <li><strong>Soup:</strong></li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots peeled, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, +/- to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper +/- to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chicken soup base/boullion</li>
      <li>8 ounce package egg noodles</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 Degrees F (220 C)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2: Prepare roasted chicken:</strong> Place chicken pieces on a rimmed baking sheet. Lightly coat with 2 teaspoons oil, then sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toss carrots, onion, and garlic with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Arrange mixture around the chicken pieces on baking sheet.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are golden brown and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 Degrees C). Remove the baking sheet from the oven and add 1 cup cold water.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Remove chicken pieces from the baking sheet and let sit until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard chicken skin. Shred meat from chicken, keeping white meat and dark meat seperate. Place bones in a large dutch oven. Set aside 3 1/2 cups white meat for the soup. Reserve dark meat and remaining white meat for another use.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 6: Prepare stock liquid:</strong> Add liquid and vegetables from the baking sheet to the Dutch oven. Add 10 cups cold water, carrots, celery, onion, parsley stems, and bay leaf; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, occasionally skimming the surface for impurities, 2 to 4 hours. Strain and discard solids and reserve stock.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 7: Prepare soup</strong></li>
      <li> Heat butter and olive oil in a clean Dutch oven over medium-high heat until butter has melted. Add carrots, celery, and onion. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cook stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, another 3 to 5 minutes. Add 10 cups reserved stock and chicken base. Then bring mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until veggies are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> While the soup is cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring it to a boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Stir cooked noodles into soup with reserved white meat and parsley. Taste and adjust flavor with salt and pepper as necessary.</li>
      <h4>Chef's Notes</h4>
      <p>If your store doesn't sell cut-up chicken on the shelves, the butcher will often cut it up for you at no extra charge. It's much easier to hand the smaller pieces than a whole bird.</p>
      <p>The stock can be made ahead of time and stored in a refridgerator for 4 days or frozen up to 6 months. </p>
      <p>Try making the soup unique and your own by adding different herbs and spices of your own.</p>
